# Developer Guide

## When exposing some service to the Web.Api project use CQRS approach with command and queries.

## When creating service which will be only used inside this project create it normally with Interface + Implementation and Export it.

## For this project you can use var instead of Strong type (Please if you need to extend some of the Framework libraries do not use var in them)

## If you get pragma warnings disable them, please dont leave them hanging.
